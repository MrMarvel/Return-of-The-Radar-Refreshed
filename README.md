# Return of The Radar \[Updated\]
Visit pa_mod folder via https://github.com/MrMarvel/Return-of-The-Radar-Refreshed/tree/prod/pa_mod_only.  
Forked and fixed version of original mod. The Orbital and Deepspace Radar from classic PA returns! All orbital units are now hidden unless the Deepspace Radar is constructed and powered. Works with base game AI. Does not affect Galactic War. Now compatible with most other mods!

## Made changes to balance:
* Increased priority to build a deep orbital radar when AI spots your orbital platform or your weaponized orbital units;
* Increased priority to build a deep orbital radar when AI builds an orbital platform.
